- additionalinfo: Incremental feeds pull only new or modified indicators that have
    been sent from the integration. As the determination if the indicator is new or
    modified happens on the 3rd-party vendor's side, and only indicators that are
    new or modified are sent to Cortex XSOAR, all indicators coming from these feeds
    are labeled new or modified.
